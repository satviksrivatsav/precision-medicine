Q: What is heart disease?
A: Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart, including blood vessel disease (coronary artery disease), irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), congenital heart defects, heart muscle disease, and heart valve disease.

Q: What are the symptoms of coronary artery disease?
A: Symptoms include chest pain or discomfort (angina), shortness of breath, pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly or back, and pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if blood vessels are narrowed.

Q: What causes coronary artery disease?
A: The most common cause is atherosclerosis - a buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances (plaque) in and on the artery walls. This buildup reduces blood flow to the heart and can lead to heart attack or stroke.

Q: What are the symptoms of heart arrhythmias?
A: Symptoms include chest pain or discomfort, dizziness, fainting, fluttering in the chest, lightheadedness, racing or slow heartbeat, and shortness of breath.

Q: What are the risk factors for heart disease?
A: Major risk factors include age, being male, family history, smoking, unhealthy diet, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise, stress, and poor dental health.

Q: How can heart disease be prevented?
A: Prevention includes not smoking, eating a diet low in salt and saturated fat, exercising at least 30 minutes daily, maintaining healthy weight, managing stress, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and getting good sleep (7-9 hours daily).

Q: When should I see a doctor for heart disease symptoms?
A: Get emergency help immediately for chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting. Call 911 if you think you're having a heart attack. Make an appointment for other concerning symptoms as early detection makes treatment easier.

Q: What are the complications of heart disease?
A: Possible complications include heart failure, heart attack, stroke, aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, and sudden cardiac arrest.

Q: What is cardiomyopathy?
A: Cardiomyopathy is disease of the heart muscle. Early stages may have no symptoms, but as it worsens, symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeats, and swollen legs or feet.

Q: What is heart valve disease?
A: Heart valve disease occurs when one of the four heart valves doesn't work properly. It can involve narrowing (stenosis) or backward blood flow (regurgitation). Symptoms include chest pain, fainting, fatigue, irregular heartbeats, shortness of breath, and swollen feet or ankles.

Q: What is the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest?
A: A heart attack occurs when blood flow to part of the heart is blocked, usually by a clot, but the heart typically continues to beat. Cardiac arrest happens when the heart suddenly stops beating due to an electrical malfunction. Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency and can lead to death if not treated immediately with CPR and defibrillation.

Q: What is angina and how is it different from a heart attack?
A: Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It is usually triggered by physical exertion or emotional stress and goes away with rest. A heart attack, on the other hand, causes permanent damage to heart muscle due to complete blockage and needs emergency treatment.

Q: Can heart disease be reversed?
A: While some damage from heart disease may be permanent, early intervention can halt or partially reverse disease progression. Lifestyle changes like eating a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, quitting smoking, and controlling blood pressure and cholesterol can significantly improve heart health.

Q: What tests are used to diagnose heart disease?
A: Common diagnostic tests include electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, stress test, chest X-ray, cardiac catheterization, CT angiography, and blood tests for cardiac markers like troponin, cholesterol, and creatine kinase.

Q: What is LDL and HDL cholesterol?
A: LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is known as "bad" cholesterol because it contributes to plaque buildup in arteries. HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is "good" cholesterol that helps remove LDL from the bloodstream. A healthy heart requires low LDL and high HDL levels.

Q: What is serum creatinine and why is it relevant to heart disease?
A: Serum creatinine is a waste product in the blood that comes from muscle activity and is filtered out by the kidneys. Elevated levels may indicate kidney dysfunction, which is a risk factor for heart disease since the heart and kidneys are closely connected.

Q: What is blood pressure and how does it affect heart disease?
A: Blood pressure is the force of circulating blood against the artery walls. High blood pressure (hypertension) can damage blood vessels and strain the heart, leading to increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure.

Q: What role does diabetes play in heart disease?
A: Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease by damaging blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart. High blood sugar levels contribute to plaque buildup in arteries and increase inflammation, both of which raise cardiovascular risk.

Q: What is an echocardiogram?
A: An echocardiogram is an ultrasound scan of the heart. It provides images that help assess heart structure and function, detect valve problems, measure ejection fraction, and identify areas of poor blood flow or damage.

Q: Can young people get heart disease?
A: Yes. Although heart disease is more common with age, young people can develop it due to factors like genetics, smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, congenital heart defects, and drug use.

Q: What is troponin and why is it tested?
A: Troponin is a protein released into the blood when heart muscle is damaged. High levels of troponin in blood tests are a key indicator of a heart attack and help doctors determine the extent of heart damage.

Q: What lifestyle changes help manage heart disease?
A: Key lifestyle changes include quitting smoking, eating more fruits and vegetables, reducing salt and saturated fat intake, exercising regularly, limiting alcohol, managing stress, and following medical advice on medications and monitoring.

Q: What is a stent and when is it used?
A: A stent is a small mesh tube inserted into a narrowed or blocked artery to keep it open. It is commonly used in coronary angioplasty to restore blood flow to the heart in people with coronary artery disease.

Q: What is ejection fraction?
A: Ejection fraction (EF) is a measurement of the percentage of blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction. A normal EF is 55% to 70%. Low EF can be a sign of heart failure or cardiomyopathy.

Q: What is heart failure?
A: Heart failure means the heart is not pumping blood as well as it should. It doesn't mean the heart has stopped, but that it is too weak or stiff to supply the bodyâ€™s needs. Symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs or ankles.

Q: What is anaemia and how does it relate to heart disease?
A: Anaemia is a condition in which you have fewer red blood cells or less hemoglobin than normal. This reduces oxygen delivery to tissues and forces the heart to work harder, increasing the risk of complications, especially in people with heart disease.

Q: What is creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and why is it important?
A: Creatinine phosphokinase is an enzyme found in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. High levels in the blood may indicate muscle damage, including heart muscle damage, and can be a sign of heart attack or heart failure.

Q: What is the connection between diabetes and heart disease?
A: Diabetes raises blood sugar levels, which damages blood vessels and nerves controlling the heart. It also increases inflammation and accelerates plaque buildup, making heart disease more likely.

Q: What is ejection fraction and why is it measured?
A: Ejection fraction (EF) is the percentage of blood the left ventricle pumps out with each heartbeat. It helps assess how well the heart is functioning. A low EF is a sign of heart failure or weakened heart muscle.

Q: What does high blood pressure mean for the heart?
A: High blood pressure (hypertension) puts extra strain on the heart and arteries, causing the heart to thicken and stiffen over time. It significantly increases the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke.

Q: What are platelets and why are their levels important in heart disease?
A: Platelets are blood components that help with clotting. Abnormal platelet counts can indicate issues like bleeding risk or blood clots, both of which can affect heart disease outcomes and treatment.

Q: What is serum creatinine and what does it indicate?
A: Serum creatinine is a waste product from muscle activity, filtered out by the kidneys. High levels suggest impaired kidney function, which is linked to worse outcomes in heart disease.

Q: What is serum sodium and why is it relevant to heart health?
A: Serum sodium is the concentration of sodium in the blood. Abnormal sodium levels, especially low sodium (hyponatremia), are common in advanced heart failure and can be a sign of poor prognosis.
