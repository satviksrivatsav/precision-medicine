Q: What is lung cancer?
A: Lung cancer is a disease caused by uncontrolled cell division in the lungs, usually starting in the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) or small air sacs (alveoli). It can form tumors and interfere with normal lung function, and can also spread to other organs.

Q: What are the types of lung cancer?
A: The main types are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and less common types like adenosquamous and sarcomatoid carcinoma. SCLC includes small cell carcinoma and combined small cell carcinoma.

Q: What are the stages of lung cancer?
A: Lung cancer stages are:
- Stage 0: Cancer is in the top lining of the lung or bronchus.
- Stage I: Cancer is only in the lung.
- Stage II: Cancer is larger or in nearby lymph nodes.
- Stage III: Cancer is in lymph nodes or structures near the lung.
- Stage IV: Cancer has spread to the other lung or distant organs.
SCLC may also be described as limited or extensive stage.

Q: What is metastatic lung cancer?
A: Metastatic lung cancer refers to lung cancer that has spread to the other lung or to other parts of the body. It is harder to treat than localized lung cancer.

Q: How common is lung cancer?
A: Lung cancer is the third most common cancer in the U.S., with over 200,000 new cases reported annually.

Q: What are the symptoms of lung cancer?
A: Symptoms include persistent or worsening cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up blood, hoarseness, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, shoulder pain, and swelling in the face or neck. Advanced symptoms may include Horner’s syndrome and superior vena cava syndrome.

Q: What are the early signs of lung cancer?
A: Early signs can include a persistent cough or recurring pneumonia. Symptoms often don’t appear until cancer has advanced.

Q: How long can you have lung cancer without knowing?
A: Lung cancer can grow for years without causing noticeable symptoms.

Q: What causes lung cancer?
A: Lung cancer is caused by genetic mutations that lead cells to divide uncontrollably. Smoking is the leading risk factor, but exposure to certain harmful substances and genetic predispositions also play a role.

Q: What are the risk factors for lung cancer?
A: Risk factors include smoking, secondhand smoke, exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, uranium, diesel exhaust, silica, coal products, prior chest radiation, and a family history of lung cancer.

Q: Can vaping cause lung cancer?
A: Vaping introduces potentially harmful substances into the lungs. While long-term effects are still being studied, vaping may increase lung cancer risk.

Q: Can non-smokers get lung cancer?
A: Yes, up to 20% of people diagnosed with lung cancer have never smoked.

Q: How is lung cancer diagnosed?
A: Diagnosis may involve a physical exam, blood tests, imaging (X-ray, CT, PET), and biopsies (needle biopsy, bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy, etc.). Genetic testing may also be done to guide treatment.

Q: Can a chest X-ray detect lung cancer?
A: X-rays are less effective than CT scans at detecting early-stage lung cancer. They may miss small tumors or those hidden by other structures.

Q: What tests are done to diagnose lung cancer?
A: Tests include blood tests, imaging (X-rays, CT scans, PET/CT), and various biopsy procedures. Biopsies may be analyzed for cancer cells and genetic mutations.

Q: How is lung cancer treated?
A: Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, targeted drug therapy, immunotherapy, and palliative care to manage symptoms.

Q: What are the side effects of lung cancer treatments?
A: 
- Chemotherapy: nausea, fatigue, hair loss, neuropathy, mouth sores.
- Immunotherapy: rash, fatigue, joint pain, nausea, diarrhea.
- Radiation: shortness of breath, pain, fatigue, skin irritation.
- Surgery: chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, cough.

Q: How can I manage symptoms and side effects?
A: Management includes medications, help from palliative care specialists, proper hydration, nutrition, and support from caregivers or dietitians.

Q: Can lung cancer be cured?
A: Some early-stage lung cancers can be cured, especially if treated before they spread. More commonly, remission or “no evidence of disease” (NED) is achieved.

Q: Does lung cancer spread quickly?
A: SCLC typically spreads more quickly than NSCLC. Many cases are diagnosed after some spread has occurred.

Q: What is the survival rate of lung cancer?
A: The overall 5-year relative survival rate is 22.9%. For localized cancer: 61.2%, regional spread: 33.5%, distant spread: 7%. NSCLC generally has higher survival rates than SCLC.

Q: How can lung cancer be prevented?
A: Prevention includes not smoking, avoiding secondhand smoke and harmful substances, maintaining a healthy diet and weight, and getting screened if at high risk.

Q: Who should get screened for lung cancer?
A: People aged 50–80 with a 20 pack-year smoking history who currently smoke or quit within the past 15 years should consider annual lung cancer screening.

Q: How can I take care of myself during lung cancer treatment?
A: Tips include bringing someone to appointments, planning for post-treatment recovery, eating well, staying hydrated, exercising as advised, staying organized, and joining support groups.

Q: When should I see a doctor about lung cancer?
A: See your doctor if you have symptoms like persistent cough, chest pain, or unexplained weight loss. If you are at high risk (e.g., smoker), ask about screening.

Q: What questions should I ask my doctor?
A: Ask about treatment options, side effects, at-home care, next steps, emergency contacts, and when to seek emergency care.

Q: What is a PET scan and why is it used in lung cancer?
A: A PET (positron emission tomography) scan uses radioactive sugar to detect active cancer cells. It helps determine if lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

Q: What is a lung nodule?
A: A lung nodule is a small, round growth in the lung, often found during imaging. Most nodules are noncancerous, but some can be early-stage lung cancer and require further testing.

Q: What is targeted therapy for lung cancer?
A: Targeted therapy uses drugs that specifically attack cancer cells with genetic mutations (like EGFR, ALK, or KRAS) while sparing normal cells. It is often used in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Q: What is immunotherapy for lung cancer?
A: Immunotherapy boosts the body's immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. It is especially helpful in advanced stages of lung cancer and is often used when other treatments are less effective.

Q: What genetic mutations are tested for in lung cancer?
A: Common mutations include EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, BRAF, and MET. Identifying these helps doctors choose the most effective targeted treatments.

Q: How is lung cancer staged with TNM classification?
A: TNM stands for Tumor size (T), Node involvement (N), and Metastasis (M). It is used to determine cancer stage and guide treatment planning.

Q: What is the difference between limited and extensive stage in small cell lung cancer?
A: In limited stage, cancer is confined to one lung and nearby lymph nodes. In extensive stage, it has spread to the other lung or distant organs. This classification helps determine treatment options.

Q: What is paraneoplastic syndrome in lung cancer?
A: Paraneoplastic syndrome is a group of rare disorders caused by immune reactions to lung cancer, not the tumor itself. Symptoms may include muscle weakness, hormone imbalances, and neurological issues.

Q: What are the signs of lung cancer spreading to the brain?
A: Symptoms include headaches, seizures, memory loss, confusion, vision changes, and difficulty speaking or walking. These require immediate medical attention.

Q: Can lung cancer cause bone pain?
A: Yes. If lung cancer spreads to the bones, it can cause pain in the back, ribs, hips, or other areas, sometimes worsening at night or with movement.

Q: What is bronchoscopy and how is it used?
A: Bronchoscopy is a procedure where a thin tube with a camera is inserted into the airways to view the lungs and collect tissue samples for biopsy.

Q: What is thoracentesis and when is it done?
A: Thoracentesis is a procedure that removes fluid from the space around the lungs (pleural effusion). It helps relieve symptoms and may aid in diagnosis.

Q: What is palliative care in lung cancer?
A: Palliative care focuses on improving quality of life by relieving symptoms like pain, breathlessness, fatigue, or anxiety. It can be used alongside curative treatments or in advanced stages.

Q: What lifestyle changes help during lung cancer treatment?
A: Avoid smoking, eat a nutritious diet, stay active if possible, get enough rest, manage stress, and follow medical guidance to reduce treatment side effects and improve recovery.

Q: Can lung cancer return after treatment?
A: Yes. Even after successful treatment, lung cancer can recur. Regular follow-ups and imaging help detect recurrence early and allow for timely intervention.

Q: What are the emotional effects of lung cancer?
A: Patients may experience anxiety, depression, fear, and emotional exhaustion. Support groups, counseling, and open communication with loved ones and healthcare providers can help.

Q: How does lung cancer affect breathing?
A: Lung cancer may cause airway obstruction, fluid buildup, or reduced lung capacity, leading to shortness of breath, wheezing, or difficulty performing daily activities.

Q: Can lung cancer be inherited?
A: While most lung cancer is caused by environmental factors like smoking, some people may inherit genetic mutations that increase their risk, especially if they have a strong family history.

Q: How is prognosis determined in lung cancer?
A: Prognosis depends on cancer type, stage, overall health, response to treatment, and presence of genetic mutations. Early detection generally improves outcomes.

Q: Why is lung cancer often diagnosed late?
A: Symptoms may be mild or mistaken for common illnesses. In many cases, lung cancer is not detected until it has advanced and caused more noticeable symptoms.
