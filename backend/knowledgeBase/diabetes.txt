A: 47% in 2021.

Q: What is type 1 diabetes?
A: A form of diabetes where the body produces little or no insulin. It requires daily insulin injections.

Q: Who typically develops type 1 diabetes?
A: It usually develops in children or young adults.

Q: Can type 1 diabetes be prevented?
A: No, the cause is unknown and there is no known prevention.

Q: What is type 2 diabetes?
A: A condition where the body does not use insulin properly, often associated with lifestyle factors.

Q: Is type 2 diabetes preventable?
A: Yes, with lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight.

Q: Who gets type 2 diabetes?
A: Mostly adults, but increasingly found in children too.

Q: What percentage of diabetes cases are type 2?
A: Over 95%.

Q: What is gestational diabetes?
A: High blood sugar during pregnancy, not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.

Q: What are the risks of gestational diabetes?
A: Pregnancy and delivery complications, and increased future risk of type 2 diabetes for both mother and child.

Q: How is gestational diabetes diagnosed?
A: Through prenatal screening, not symptoms.

Q: What are IGT and IFG?
A: Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Impaired Fasting Glycaemia are conditions that increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Q: Do IGT and IFG always lead to diabetes?
A: No, but they indicate higher risk.

Q: How can type 2 diabetes be prevented?
A: By maintaining a healthy weight, staying active, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding tobacco.

Q: How much physical activity is recommended to prevent type 2 diabetes?
A: At least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.

Q: How is diabetes diagnosed?
A: With blood glucose tests.

Q: How is type 1 diabetes treated?
A: With daily insulin injections.

Q: How is type 2 diabetes treated?
A: Through lifestyle changes, oral medications, and sometimes insulin.

Q: What are common medications for type 2 diabetes?
A: Metformin, sulfonylureas, and SGLT-2 inhibitors.

Q: What additional care may people with diabetes need?
A: Blood pressure medication, statins, foot care, kidney disease screening, and eye exams.

Q: How does diabetes increase the risk of heart disease?
A: Diabetes damages blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart. High blood sugar causes inflammation and accelerates plaque buildup in arteries, making heart attacks and strokes more likely.

Q: What is insulin and what role does it play in diabetes?
A: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps cells absorb glucose from the blood. In diabetes, insulin is either lacking or not used effectively, leading to high blood sugar levels.

Q: What is HbA1c and why is it important?
A: HbA1c is a blood test that shows the average blood sugar level over the past 2 to 3 months. Itâ€™s used to diagnose diabetes and monitor how well it is being managed. A result of 6.5% or higher typically indicates diabetes.

Q: What is fasting blood glucose?
A: Fasting blood glucose is the level of sugar in the blood after not eating for at least 8 hours. A value of 126 mg/dL or higher usually indicates diabetes.

Q: What is postprandial blood glucose?
A: Postprandial blood glucose is the level of sugar in the blood measured two hours after eating. High levels may indicate impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes.

Q: Can diabetes be managed without medication?
A: Yes, especially in early stages of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle changes like diet, physical activity, and weight loss can help control blood sugar levels. However, many people will eventually need medication.

Q: What are the long-term complications of uncontrolled diabetes?
A: Long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, nerve damage (neuropathy), eye damage (retinopathy), poor wound healing, and increased risk of infections.

Q: How does diabetes affect kidney health?
A: Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease. High blood sugar damages the small blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing their filtering ability and leading to kidney failure if not managed.

Q: How often should someone with diabetes see a doctor?
A: Regular check-ups every 3 to 6 months are recommended, along with annual screenings for eye health, kidney function, and foot health to catch complications early.

Q: What is diabetic neuropathy?
A: Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage caused by long-term high blood sugar. It commonly affects the legs and feet, causing pain, tingling, numbness, or weakness.

Q: What is prediabetes?
A: Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Without intervention, it often progresses to type 2 diabetes.

Q: Can someone have diabetes and not know it?
A: Yes. Type 2 diabetes often develops slowly and may have no obvious symptoms in the early stages, so many people remain undiagnosed for years.

Q: What is the role of diet in managing diabetes?
A: A healthy diet can help control blood sugar levels, manage weight, and reduce the risk of complications. It typically includes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and limited sugar and saturated fats.

Q: What is continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)?
A: CGM uses a small sensor under the skin to track blood sugar levels in real time throughout the day and night. It helps people with diabetes manage their condition more effectively.

Q: What are SGLT2 inhibitors and how do they help in diabetes?
A: SGLT2 inhibitors are a class of diabetes medication that lower blood sugar by causing the kidneys to remove glucose through urine. They also reduce the risk of heart failure and kidney disease.

Q: Is there a cure for diabetes?
A: There is no cure for diabetes, but it can be effectively managed. Type 2 diabetes remission is possible in some cases through significant weight loss and lifestyle changes.

Q: How many types of diabetes are there?
A: There are three types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational.
