Q: What is chronic kidney disease?
A: Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. The kidneys filter waste and excess fluids from the blood, which are excreted in urine. Advanced kidney disease can lead to dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes, and waste buildup in the body.

Q: What are the symptoms of chronic kidney disease?
A: Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, sleep problems, urinating more or less, decreased mental sharpness, muscle cramps, swollen feet or ankles, dry and itchy skin, high blood pressure, shortness of breath, and chest pain.

Q: When should I see a doctor for possible kidney disease?
A: You should see a doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease. Early detection can help prevent progression to kidney failure.

Q: How is chronic kidney disease detected early?
A: People at risk should have regular urine and blood tests to monitor kidney function and blood pressure.

Q: What causes chronic kidney disease?
A: Causes include type 1 or 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, prolonged urinary tract obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, and recurrent kidney infections.

Q: What are the risk factors for chronic kidney disease?
A: Risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, smoking, obesity, being Black, Native American, or Asian American, family history of kidney disease, abnormal kidney structure, older age, and frequent use of medications that harm kidneys.

Q: What are the complications of chronic kidney disease?
A: Complications include fluid retention, high potassium (hyperkalemia), anemia, heart disease, weak bones, sexual dysfunction, central nervous system damage, decreased immunity, pericarditis, pregnancy complications, and end-stage kidney failure.

Q: What happens in end-stage kidney disease?
A: In end-stage kidney disease, the kidneys can no longer function on their own and survival requires dialysis or a kidney transplant.

Q: Can chronic kidney disease be prevented?
A: Yes. Prevention includes taking medications as directed, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and managing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure with medical guidance.

Q: How can over-the-counter medications affect kidney health?
A: Long-term or excessive use of nonprescription pain relievers like aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen can lead to kidney damage.

Q: How does smoking affect the kidneys?
A: Smoking damages the kidneys and can worsen existing kidney disease. Quitting smoking helps reduce this risk.

Q: Why is managing other health conditions important for kidney health?
A: Conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure directly impact kidney function. Managing them helps prevent or slow kidney damage.

Q: What is glomerular filtration rate (GFR)?
A: GFR is a blood test that estimates how well your kidneys are filtering waste. A GFR above 90 is normal. A GFR below 60 for three months or more is a sign of chronic kidney disease.

Q: What is creatinine and why is it measured in kidney disease?
A: Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles and filtered by the kidneys. High blood creatinine levels suggest reduced kidney function.

Q: What is albuminuria?
A: Albuminuria is the presence of albumin (a protein) in the urine. It indicates kidney damage, as healthy kidneys normally prevent protein from leaking into the urine.

Q: How is chronic kidney disease staged?
A: CKD is classified into five stages based on GFR, from Stage 1 (normal GFR but with damage) to Stage 5 (end-stage kidney failure with GFR < 15).

Q: Can chronic kidney disease be cured?
A: No, CKD usually cannot be cured, but it can often be managed to slow progression and reduce complications.

Q: How does chronic kidney disease affect the heart?
A: CKD increases the risk of heart disease. Damaged kidneys raise blood pressure, alter fluid balance, and cause inflammation, all of which strain the heart.

Q: What lifestyle changes help manage chronic kidney disease?
A: Key changes include eating a low-sodium and low-protein diet, quitting smoking, staying active, controlling blood pressure and blood sugar, and avoiding kidney-damaging drugs.

Q: What is dialysis and when is it needed?
A: Dialysis is a treatment that filters waste, water, and toxins from the blood when the kidneys can no longer do so. It is required in end-stage kidney disease.

Q: What are the types of dialysis?
A: The main types are hemodialysis (blood is filtered through a machine) and peritoneal dialysis (the abdomen is used to filter blood using a dialysis solution).

Q: What is a kidney transplant?
A: A kidney transplant involves replacing a failed kidney with a healthy one from a donor. It can restore normal kidney function and eliminate the need for dialysis.

Q: What dietary changes are recommended for people with kidney disease?
A: A kidney-friendly diet may limit protein, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and fluids, depending on disease stage and lab results. Individual recommendations vary.

Q: What is potassium and why is it important in kidney disease?
A: Potassium helps regulate heart and muscle function. Damaged kidneys may not remove excess potassium, leading to high levels (hyperkalemia), which can be life-threatening.

Q: What is phosphorus and how does it relate to kidney disease?
A: Phosphorus is a mineral important for bones. In kidney disease, phosphorus can build up in the blood and cause bone and heart problems.

Q: What is anemia in chronic kidney disease?
A: Anemia is a common complication of CKD caused by reduced production of erythropoietin, a hormone made by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production.

Q: What is erythropoietin (EPO)?
A: EPO is a hormone produced by the kidneys that helps the body make red blood cells. In CKD, reduced EPO levels lead to anemia and fatigue.

Q: Can exercise help people with chronic kidney disease?
A: Yes. Moderate physical activity can help lower blood pressure, improve energy, and support heart and kidney health in people with CKD.

Q: What are phosphate binders and why are they used?
A: Phosphate binders are medications taken with food to reduce phosphate absorption in the gut. They help control high blood phosphate levels in advanced kidney disease.

Q: How often should kidney function be monitored?
A: People at risk or with CKD should have kidney function monitored with regular blood and urine tests, usually every 3 to 6 months depending on the severity.

Q: Is chronic kidney disease common?
A: Yes. CKD affects over 850 million people worldwide and is often underdiagnosed, especially in early stages.
