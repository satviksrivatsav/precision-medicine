# ‚ù§Ô∏è Precision Medicine: Heart Disease Prediction App

## About The Project

This project is an end-to-end data science application that predicts the likelihood of mortality from heart failure based on a patient's clinical records. 

The application features a machine learning model that has been tuned for high performance and includes model explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). This allows users to not only get a prediction but also understand the key factors driving that prediction, aligning with the principles of precision medicine.

### Key Features:
*   **High-Performance Model:** A tuned Random Forest Classifier achieving an AUC of **0.928** on the test set.
*   **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrated SHAP waterfall plots to explain each prediction, making the model's decisions transparent.
*   **End-to-End Workflow:** Demonstrates the full data science lifecycle from data analysis and preprocessing to model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.

### Tech Stack
*   **Python**
*   **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
*   **Scikit-learn** for modeling and preprocessing
*   **XGBoost** & **Random Forest** for model training
*   **SHAP** for model explainability
*   **Streamlit** for the web application interface
*   **Docker** for containerization
